###November 2014 1 Game A Month (1GAM)

Vector Trigger is an environmental puzzle game similar to Portal or Mirrors Edge. Traverse a Callagari-esque world, flying through the air, teleporting, with the occasional mis-step into the abyss.

This was a solo project I made for 1 Game A  Month. I am responsbile for all code and art. You can [download the built version here] (http://jesterswilde.itch.io/vector-trigger)
